# socko
socko is a simple library for server-browser WebSocket communication in a more straightforward way than plain raw WebSockets. It is built on top of the Gorilla websocket library.

The goal of socko is to add a thin layer of abstraction on top of raw WebSocket behaviors to make writing webapps easier. I began writing the library alongside another project I've since scrapped.
